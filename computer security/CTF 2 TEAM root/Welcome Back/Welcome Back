Exploited Return orinented-GoT accorading to the provided paper link. responses is closest to global object table so it is used to overwrite GoT address. objdump -D welcom_back showed address of responses as "0601be0" so we overwrite address of GoT as "0601be0"-hexa(128x20). name is given 79 length string on giving 80 length string it is getting overflowed same is the case with responses.
"printf" address in GoT is overwritten with address of "system" and %s argument of printf is given to system as a binary file in the ccurrent directory. so now whenever printf is called from welcome_back it invokes system call and prints flag.txt.
