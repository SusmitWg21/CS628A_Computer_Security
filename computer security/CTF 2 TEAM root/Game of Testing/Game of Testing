exploiting following sequence of code where input string to "buf" is being executed 
g4 = &v1; g2 = 1; g3 = 255; ((int32_t (*)())buf)();
System call number for WRITE is 4.
we transfered eax to ecx and zeroed eax by XOring, and call number 0x4 copied to lower byte of eax i.e. %al and then interrupted with $0x80
the respective instruction address were given input to the program to execute the write system call.
